# GuildedRose

## What was done?

The guildedrose kata was refactored using the Liskov substitution principle.
Conjured was implemented

## How was testing done?
Testing was done by saving the output to files and then comparing the files for changes using the commandline.

### Should you do testing this way?
Nope, it can not be recommended. It is npt automated and it is painful to do everytime... so the developer is likely to skip it.
It was done this way in this project to test and compare different methods of validating software changes.
