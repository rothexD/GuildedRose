# GuildedRose

## What was done?

The guildedrose kata was refactored using the Liskov substitution principle.
Conjured was implemented

## How was testing done?
Testing was done saving the output to files and then comparing the files for changes using commandline

### Should you do testing this way?
Nope, it can not be recommended. It isnt automated and painful to do everytime so the developer is likely to skip it.
It was done in this project to test and compare different methods of validating software changes.
